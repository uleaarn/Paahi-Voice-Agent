# Managing Restaurant Order Hours

Restaurant Owners can now configure specific windows for accepting pickup and delivery orders.

### How to change hours:
1. Log in to the **Paahi Host** dashboard using your Owner account.
2. Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right header.
3. In the "Order Hours" window:
   - Select your local **Timezone**.
   - Set the **First Order Time** (when Paahi starts taking orders).
   - Set the **Last Order Time** (when Paahi stops taking orders).
4. Click **Save Settings**.

### AI Behavior:
Once saved, Paahi will automatically validate all incoming order requests. If a customer asks for a time outside your window, Paahi will:
- Politely inform them of your hours.
- Suggest the next available opening time.
- Block the order from reaching the POS until a valid time is chosen.
